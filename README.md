## Finding the Dataset

The dataset can be found at this [link](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

I've also attached a script called `setup_project.bin` that can be run by cloning the repository and then running `./setup_project`. 

This will automatically download the data and put it in the base repository with the file name of `dataset-ml-32m/`, and also setup a virtual environment and run the `requirements.txt` file found within this repo. Note: `dataset-ml-32m` is the default name that the data is stored in if you manually download it and unzip it.

As a recap: if you want to let the script download the data and set up the virtual environment, run `./setup_project`. Otherwise, go to the link from above, download the `ml-32m.zip`, navigate it to this repository, unzip it, and you'll be all set with the data. Just don't forget to make your virtual environment as well!
